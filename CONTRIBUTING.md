# Contributing to `ai-project-todo-structure`

We welcome contributions to the `ai-project-todo-structure` project! By contributing, you help improve the standardization of AI-friendly project to-do lists for the entire developer community.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

1.  **Suggest Improvements to the Standard:**
    * Open an issue on the GitHub repository to propose changes or additions to the `todo.json` schema.
    * Clearly explain your rationale and the benefits of the proposed change for AI understanding and developer usability.

2.  **Report Issues/Bugs:**
    * If you find any inconsistencies, errors, or ambiguities in the standard or its examples, please open an issue.
    * Provide a clear description of the problem and steps to reproduce (if applicable).

3.  **Submit Pull Requests (Documentation/Templates):**
    * **Fork the repository.**
    * **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/add-status-field`, `fix/typo-in-example`).
    * **Make your changes.** Ensure your changes align with the project's goals and maintain consistency.
    * **Write clear commit messages** using Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add 'epicId' field to tasks`).
    * **Run the linter** by executing `npm test` to check for JSON errors before committing.
    * **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch.
    * Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.
